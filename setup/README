Deps for Install:
---------------------------------------
Facter - you'll need this for Puppet anyways
Python2.6 -  for python IO
Bind - The Standard in DNS

Working Yum repos - i.e. EPEL repo & CentOS repo files


Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------
1) install bind
2) create /var/named/zones/master
3) reset_master.py gets called via rc.local
    U can run this manually the 1st time but each time
    u reboot it needs to run again to setup resolv.conf for other
    nodes and it self since it will put this into a S3 bucket so
    nodes can cron pull it. Ideally u shd have 2 small nodes to handle
    dns for fault tolerance.

4) run setup_named.py

--more to come soon including aws scripts.
  reorganizing the repo soon as well most
  of it will go into classes
